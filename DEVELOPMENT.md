# Development Guide

Canonical development documentation is split for faster onboarding:

- Local setup: [`docs/development/local-setup.md`](docs/development/local-setup.md)
- Stats runtime architecture and contracts: [`docs/development/stats-runtime.md`](docs/development/stats-runtime.md)
- Security and secrets: [`docs/operations/security-secrets.md`](docs/operations/security-secrets.md)

If guidance here and `docs/` disagree, treat `docs/` as the source of truth.
